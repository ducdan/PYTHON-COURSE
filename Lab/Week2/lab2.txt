1. Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically. 
	Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

	Example input: New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or Python 3.

	Output:
	2:2
	3.:1
	3?:1
	New:1
	Python:5
	Read:1
	and:1
	between:1
	choosing:1
	or:2
	to:1


2. Define a class named Circle which can be constructed by a radius. The Circle class has a method which can compute the area. 
	Example:
		aCircle = Circle(2)
		print aCircle.area() //16.56

3. Define a class named Rectangle which can be constructed by a length and width. The Rectangle class has a method which can compute the area.
